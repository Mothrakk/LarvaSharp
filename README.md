# LarvaSharp

## What is this?

The idea was to fix an issue that data hoarders/web scrapers/on-the-spectrum scripters run into. And that is running a dozen scripts simultaneously from which you want to read output from and sometimes pass input into. This results in a terribly cluttered screen.

So the idea was to turn this:

Into this:

### Basically, it's an I/O manager capable of handling a plethora of scripts/modules that run as independent processes.

Also, Larva can do other things through hardcoded commands. Like evaluating a string as if you were to pass it into Python. Makes for a quick calculator.

Sky's the limit, really.
